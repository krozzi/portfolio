## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm ddozzi.
Though you might know me better as Jayden. Currently, I'm a freshman in Highschool; well, more like a "to-be-freshman".

### Note
This is an extremely condensed version of my journey. Contact me if you want to know more lol.
This is probably going to be the only blog post that's all about me. So enjoy, I guess.

### My first experiences
I was introduced to my first programming language when I was 9; HTML. (yes, i know its technically not a programming language, but a markup language. please shut up.) After trying to read tutorials on how to use HTML, I figured it was essentially worthless because "it couldn't make games" and gave up on programming for the time being.

### The beginning
After deciding to take part in the science fair in 6th grade, I came up with the topic of "Can Machine Learning Detect Chronic Kidney Disease" after doing "Does the 5-second rule work" the year prior. It was a lofty goal for my age, but it was a goal I've now come to appreciate. Being the dumb kid that I am, I asked my dad how I should go about doing this project. He suggested I use R, and so I did. I regretted it immediately. Hours of learning a language from my dad, acting like I understood everything he was saying.. it was painful to say the least. After several weeks of learning the language and getting my dad to write most of the code, the model was fully trained and ready to be tested. Suprisingly, it got an accuracy rate of 99.9%. To sum up what happened next, I got 1st in the school, 1st at district, 1st for category at district, and lost at regionals because COVID required we make presentations and I made a very crappy one and sucked at presenting online (for reference, I made it to the state fair in 5th grade and couldn't go any further because they didn't let elementry kids go to the nationals). I'd love to share more details about my experiences with the science fair, but that's for another blog post...maybe.

A few months after the science fair, I decided to revisit programming, but on my own. I heard that Python was pretty good for beginners and that it had a lot of use cases so I decided to try using it. After trying to find a good tutorial, I eventually came to the conclusion that tutorials sucked because they suck at explaining stuff. So I decided to teach myself Python. Took a few months, but I got there eventually. 

### The Golden age
After learning almost everything about Python (I was 13), I decided to learn Java. And holy shit that was the best decision of my life. Java opened so many new paths for me. It made me realize how awesome OOP was, how limited Python had been, and that I could make Minecraft Mods. Through making Minecraft mods, and eventually Minecraft clients, I learned pretty much everything about Java. With the knowledge of both Interpreted languages and Programming languages, I felt like I could do anything. And that was true... for a while. I taught myself C#, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript, and so much more.

### Mid-Golden age
Around the time I was making Minecraft clients, our teacher made us do a science fair project. Being the nerd that I was, along with the knowledge I had, I created my most advanced project I could think of; Self-driving cars. More specifically, the lane-detection system that powers self-driving cars. I titled it "AI-based Lane Detection Systems-The Proactive Safeguard for Drivers". I essentially just trained a CNN Model to detect lane lines and created a project with it. I'll probably create another blog post with more details later.

The Results? 1st place all the way until regionals, then 2nd place at the State Science fair.


### Present day
I'm 14 now. Today is my birthday. I've submitted an application for the National Science Fair and I'm currently waiting for a response. I decided to teach myself HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and NextJS like 3 days ago, and I've kinda already figured out everything. Also, RIP Technoblade. 

### TL;DR
First blog post. Dang that took a long time.

My first language was HTML, but I gave up after learning I couldn't really make full-on games with it. I then learned R from my dad, but didn't understand a thing. I decided to revist programming a bit later and learned Python. I decided to learn Java and a bunch of other languages after. 3 days ago i decided to learn webdevelopment, it was pretty easy.
